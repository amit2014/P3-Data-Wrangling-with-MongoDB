# P3-Data-Wrangling-with-MongoDB
This is the 3rd project for the Udacity Data Analyst - Nanodegree. I was tasked at choosing any area of the world from https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. I chose the GVRD, or Greater Vancouver Regional District, which is my home region. Python was used to clean the data and prepare it for inserting into the NoSQL database: MongoDB. Many queries were then run to arrive at interesting findings. Finally, an R Markdown document was created to easily showcase all the queries in the final pdf report.
